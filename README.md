### Hi there 👋

I'm a Developer Support Engineer at GitHub 🐙, helping developers navigate the world of APIs, webhooks, and GitHub Apps. If you're working on an open-source project that integrates with GitHub, I'd love to collaborate! 🚀

Beyond supporting amazing GitHub developers, I'm diving deep into cybersecurity 🛡️—constantly learning, building, and breaking things (ethically, of course!). You'll often find me experimenting with security projects 🔐, sharpening my skills, and exploring new ways to make the web a safer place.

Let's connect, build, and secure awesome things together! ⚡
